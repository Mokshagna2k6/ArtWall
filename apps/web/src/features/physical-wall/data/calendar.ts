 * The exhibition calendar (F16).

 * A read model over bookings and slots: no new tables, because a calendar is a
 * way of looking at bookings rather than a thing that exists on its own.
 *
 * The valuable half is gap detection. A slot that sits empty for three days or
 * more is revenue the wall did not earn, and the spec asks that those gaps be
 * surfaced with a waitlist suggestion attached — so the calendar's job is not
 * to be pretty but to point at the holes.
