 * cause us to store an agreement nobody agreed to. The artist typing their name
 * is the signature; the hash is what makes it provable.
 *
 * Signing unlocks install scheduling, and its absence blocks go-live. That gate
 * lives in the ops action, not here, so an unsigned booking cannot be walked
 * past by calling a different endpoint.
