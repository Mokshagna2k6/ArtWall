/**
 * The six systems, as a card grid.
 *
 * Three across, dropping to two then one. Each card carries a numbered badge,
 * the system name, its short line, and a disclosure that opens the full
 * description in place.
 *
 * Why disclosure rather than truncating the detail at a character count: the
 * copy already has a written short line and a written long one, so cutting a
 * sentence mid-word to make it fit is throwing away work an editor already
 * did. The card shows the short line, and "Find out more" reveals the rest
 * without a navigation.
 *
 * Accessibility: the toggle is a real button with `aria-expanded` and
 * `aria-controls`, and the detail is a plain region - no ARIA widget pattern
 * to learn. The card's height changes on open, so the grid uses `items-start`
 * to stop a row of neighbours stretching to match.

                `object-contain` on a tinted ground, not `cover`: these are
                diagrams with labels in them, and the six arrive at ratios from
                1.27 to 1.5. Cropping them to a common box would slice the
                edges off half the set, so they are matted instead — which is
                how a gallery hangs work of differing sizes anyway. */}
