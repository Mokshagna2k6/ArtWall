 *  - A honeypot field rejects the common bot case with no user-visible cost
 *    and no CAPTCHA (which would be a real accessibility tax on artists).
 *  - Rate limited per client, per window.
 *  - Errors returned to the client are deliberately generic; the specific
 *    cause is logged server-side. Leaking "webhook returned 403" would tell an
 *    attacker about our infrastructure.
 *  - Next.js Server Actions carry built-in CSRF protection (origin checking),
 *    so no separate token is needed here.
