/**
 * Delivery URLs - where the compression actually happens.
 *
 * An artist photographs a canvas on a phone and hands us 6MB. We do not
 * re-encode that at upload: Cloudinary transforms on delivery and caches the
 * result, so the *original* stays pristine (it is the archival record behind a
 * provenance claim) while every visitor is served a small, modern-format,
 * correctly-sized image.
 *
 * `f_auto` picks AVIF or WebP per browser, `q_auto` picks a quality that holds
 * up on the specific image rather than a blanket number, and `dpr_auto` covers
 * retina without shipping 2× pixels to everyone. On the wall grid that is
 * typically 6MB down to roughly 30–60KB.
 *
 * No secrets here on purpose - this is pure string building, so it is safe in
 * client components. Signing lives in `cloudinary.ts`, which is server-only.
