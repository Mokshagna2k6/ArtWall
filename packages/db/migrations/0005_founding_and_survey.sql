-- ArtWall — signed-in founding artists, and the pain-point survey
--
-- Two changes, both driven by the same decision: joining the wall now requires
-- an account, so a roster row can finally be tied to a real user.
--
--  * `user_id` links a roster entry to the Better Auth `user` that created it.
--    `on delete set null` rather than `cascade`: if someone deletes their
--    account we must not silently vaporise a numbered place and renumber the
--    wall around it. The row stays, the link goes.
--  * `founding_member` is an explicit opt-in. Holding a place and *claiming
--    founding status* are different promises, and the second one has to be
--    asked for rather than assumed.
--
-- The survey is its own table, not more columns on the roster. Someone can
-- answer it without joining, and an artist can answer it more than once as
-- their practice changes — neither fits a one-row-per-email roster.

-- NOTE: scripts/migrate.mjs splits this file on semicolons, so every statement
-- here must be a single flat statement. No DO $$ ... $$ blocks.
alter table waitlist_entries

-- Paired DROP IF EXISTS + ADD, rather than a bare ADD.
--
-- The runner records applied files, so in theory this runs exactly once. In
-- practice a run that failed *after* this statement leaves the constraint in
-- place but the file unrecorded, and the retry then dies on "constraint already
-- exists" — which is exactly what happened to this project's database. Postgres
-- has no ADD CONSTRAINT IF NOT EXISTS, and the runner forbids DO blocks, so
-- dropping first is the way to make the statement re-runnable. The drop is
-- harmless: the constraint is immediately re-added with the same definition.

-- The pain-point survey.
--
-- `pain_points` is a text[] rather than a join table: the option list is short,
-- fixed, and only ever read as a whole. A join table here would be three
-- queries and a migration every time we reword an option.
