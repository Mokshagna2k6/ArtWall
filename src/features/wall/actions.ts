 *  - `isOwnAsset` rejects any URL that is not in our own Cloudinary cloud and
 *    inside the folder we signed. Without it, anyone could POST a link to an
 *    arbitrary image on the internet and have it published under their name.
 *  - The moderation verdict is re-fetched from Cloudinary rather than taken
 *    from the form, and a rejected image is stored hidden. The artist is told
 *    it is under review - not that they were flagged, which would be both
 *    accusatory and useless if the classifier was wrong.
 *  - Rate limited, honeypotted, and CSRF-protected by Server Actions' own
 *    origin checking.
