 * Shrink an image in the browser before it is uploaded.

 * This is the single biggest performance lever in the upload path. Phone
 * cameras produce 4–12 MB files; on Indian mobile data an uncompressed upload
 * is slow enough that people abandon it. Resizing the long edge to 1800px and
 * re-encoding typically cuts that by 80–95% with no visible loss at the sizes
 * the wall ever displays.
 *
 * It also protects the wall's render performance: Cloudinary still transforms
 * on delivery, but a smaller original means faster first transform and less
 * storage.
 *
 * `createImageBitmap` decodes off the main thread where supported, so a large
 * photo does not freeze the page while it is being read. WebP is preferred when
 * the browser can encode it (smaller at equal quality) with JPEG as fallback.
 *
 * EXIF is intentionally dropped by the canvas round-trip - camera files carry
 * GPS coordinates, and an artist uploading from home should not be publishing
 * their address along with their painting.
