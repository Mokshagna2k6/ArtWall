/**
 * The Ric Platter coupon (RP01).
 *
 * A member of Platter's counter staff scans an artist's or visitor's code,
 * types the bill total, and the system applies the discount and logs the sale.
 * No POS integration, no menu, no food payments — the scan *is* the sale signal,
 * and `bill_amount_paise` is the single field the whole attribution story rests
 * on.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does not do:
 *  - collect payment for food (Platter bills directly, so Artwall is not a GST
 *    e-commerce operator), and
 *  - store which dish anyone ate. The bill total is the only figure captured.
