/**
 * Walk-in visitor registration and scan tracking (F26, F21).
 *
 * The DPDP position drives the shape of both:
 *
 *  - Registration is **consent-first**. `consentPurpose` is a literal `true` in
 *    the schema, so no consent is a schema failure and the row is never written.
 *    Marketing consent is a separate, optional field — bundling them is exactly
 *    the dark pattern the spec rules out.
 *  - Scans store no IP address and no user agent. The shared rate limiter only
 *    stores an HMAC of its key (never the IP) in a counter row that is swept
 *    once expired, so the demand signal stays honest without the platform
 *    holding a log of who stood in front of which painting.
