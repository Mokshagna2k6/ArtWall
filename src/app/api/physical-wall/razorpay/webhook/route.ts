/**
 * Razorpay webhook (F17).
 *
 * This route, and nothing else, is what makes a booking paid. A client callback
 * saying "payment succeeded" is a claim from an untrusted party; a
 * signature-verified webhook is Razorpay telling us directly. Trusting the
 * former is how a booking gets confirmed without money moving.
 *
 * Three properties matter and all three are here:
 *
 *  - **Raw body.** The HMAC is over the exact bytes received. Reading
 *    `request.json()` first and re-serialising reorders keys and changes
 *    whitespace, and the signature stops matching — so the text is read once,
 *    verified, and only then parsed.
 *  - **Idempotency.** Razorpay retries. The event id is stored on a unique
 *    column, so a redelivery is a no-op rather than a second ledger entry.
 *  - **Always 200 on a handled event.** A non-2xx makes Razorpay retry, which
 *    is right for a transient failure and wrong for "we already have this" or
 *    "this event isn't one we care about".
