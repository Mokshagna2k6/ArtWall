# ArtWall WMS — Production Audit

> **Date:** 22 August 2026
> **Auditor:** Senior Staff Engineer / Production Readiness Audit
> **Spec source:** `AWL/ENG/2026/WMS-SPEC-001` v1.0 — August 2026
> **Codebase:** `a:\All projects\ArtWall`

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The ArtWall WMS is a **substantial, well-architected implementation** of the core exhibition lifecycle. The domain logic is pure and testable, transactions are correctly used for all multi-step mutations, RBAC is server-enforced, and the DPDP consent model is thoughtfully designed.

**However, the application is NOT production-ready.** Critical gaps exist in:

1. **Secrets management** — Real production credentials are committed to the repository in `.env` (database URL, Better Auth secret, Google OAuth, Cloudinary, Razorpay test keys).
2. ~~**Payment integrity**~~ — **RESOLVED (Phase 0):** `settleFromWebhook` now verifies the captured amount against the booking total (`PreconditionError(422)` on mismatch). Remaining: configure `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in production (external dependency).
3. ~~**Testing**~~ — **IMPROVED (Phase 0):** 6 test files / 98 tests pass, including a concurrency test proving 50 parallel booking attempts cannot double-book, and security tests for webhook forgery, QR tampering, and RBAC hierarchy.
4. **Infrastructure** — No CI/CD, no monitoring, no structured logging, no backups/DR, no staging environment.
5. **Missing features** — F25 (Selfie UGC), F28 (Full-Text Search), F30 (Community Gallery) are entirely missing. F27 (Live Carousel) is partial.
6. **Compliance** — No data retention jobs, no processor documentation, no incident response plan, no breach response workflow.
7. **Operational gaps** — No notification system, no audit log viewer, no grievance response inbox, no artist scan analytics, no offer acceptance UI.

## 3. Security Audit

### 3.1 Critical Findings

| # | Finding | Severity | Evidence | Risk |
| -- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ---- |
| S1 | **Real production credentials committed to git** | **CRITICAL** | `.env` contains: `DATABASE_URL` (Neon), `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_URL` (with API secret), `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID/SECRET` | Database compromise, auth bypass, payment fraud, data breach |
| S2 | **Razorpay webhook secret not set** | **CRITICAL** | `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` absent from `.env`; `verifyWebhookSignature` returns `false` when secret missing | Payments cannot be confirmed via webhook; booking confirmation broken |
| S3 | ~~**No webhook amount verification**~~ | **RESOLVED** | `settleFromWebhook` now passes `amountPaise` and `settleBooking` throws `PreconditionError(422)` on mismatch (Phase 0 fix) | Fixed |
| S4 | **No CSRF protection beyond Next.js defaults** | **MEDIUM** | Server actions rely on Next.js built-in CSRF protection; no explicit CSRF tokens | Potential CSRF on state-changing actions |
| S5 | **No 2FA for staff/admin accounts** | **MEDIUM** | Better Auth configured with email/password + Google only; no TOTP/2FA | Admin account compromise |
| S6 | **In-memory rate limiting only** | **MEDIUM** | `rate-limit.ts` uses in-process Map; ineffective on serverless/multi-instance | Rate-limit bypass |
| S7 | ~~**No CSP/security headers**~~ | **RESOLVED** | `next.config.ts` now sets CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS (Phase 0 fix) | Fixed |
| S8 | **No file upload validation** | **MEDIUM** | Cloudinary handles uploads but no server-side MIME/magic-byte validation; `isOwnAsset` checks host but not file content | Malicious file upload |
| S9 | **No SSRF protection on Cloudinary URL** | **LOW** | `isOwnAsset` validates hostname but doesn't prevent SSRF via Cloudinary URL manipulation | SSRF |
| S10 | **No dependency vulnerability scanning** | **MEDIUM** | No `npm audit`/`pnpm audit` in CI; no Dependabot | Known CVEs |
| S11 | **No secret scanning** | **MEDIUM** | No secret scanning in CI; `.env` committed | Secret exposure |
| S12 | **No session revocation on role change** | **LOW** | Role read fresh from DB per request (good), but no explicit session revocation | Stale sessions |

### 3.2 Security Strengths

- Server-side authorization on every write action (`requireRole`)
- Default-deny RBAC with 4 roles
- Transactional integrity with `FOR UPDATE` row locks
- QR tokens are HMAC-signed, revocable, and contain no personal data
- Webhook signature verification (when secret is set)
- No card data stored — Razorpay is PCI-scoped
- Money stored as integer paise
- Audit logging on all sensitive operations
- Consent records with purpose, version, timestamp, withdrawal
- No IP/user-agent stored against scans
- `server-only` imports prevent client bundle leakage
- Cloudinary signed uploads (no unsigned presets)

## 4. Database Audit

### 4.1 Schema Quality

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Foreign keys | ✅ | All relationships have FKs with appropriate `ON DELETE` behavior |
| Unique constraints | ✅ | Email, handle, grid cell, booking-slot, event_id, source_ref, one-per-visit/booking |
| Check constraints | ✅ | State enums, money >= 0, date ranges, role values |
| Indexes | ✅ | All query paths have supporting indexes |
| Transactions | ✅ | `inTransaction` helper with proper rollback |
| Row locking | ✅ | `FOR UPDATE` on critical paths |
| Optimistic locking | ✅ | `version` column on slots and grid config |
| Money handling | ✅ | Integer paise throughout |
| Audit records | ✅ | `pw_audit_log` append-only |
| Soft deletion | ⚠️ | Used where appropriate (waitlist status, consent withdrawal) but not consistently |
| Immutable financial records | ⚠️ | Ledger entries are append-only via `source_ref` unique, but manual entries can be edited |
| Migration safety | ⚠️ | Migrations are idempotent but no expand-and-contract strategy; no rollback strategy |

### 4.2 Missing Database Features

- No `pw_ugc_submissions` table (F25/F30)
- No `pw_notifications` table
- No `pw_search_index` table (F28)
- No `pw_identity_verifications` table (F31)
- No `pw_retention_jobs` tracking
- No `pw_processor_agreements` documentation table
- No `pw_incident_reports` table

## 14. Production Blockers

### P0 — Launch Blockers

1. ~~**Secrets committed to git**~~ — **RESOLVED**: `.env` is gitignored and not tracked. However, credentials are still in `.env` which should be moved to proper environment variable management for production.
2. **Razorpay webhook secret missing** — `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must be set; webhook verification is currently broken.
3. ~~**No webhook amount verification**~~ — **RESOLVED (Phase 0)**: `settleBooking` now rejects mismatched amounts with `PreconditionError(422)`.
4. **F25 (Selfie UGC) missing** — Entire feature absent.
5. **F28 (Full-Text Search) missing** — Entire feature absent.
6. **F30 (Community Gallery) missing** — Entire feature absent.
7. ~~**No integration/concurrency/security tests**~~ — **PARTIALLY RESOLVED (Phase 0)**: Concurrency test (50 parallel attempts, no double-booking) and security tests (webhook forgery, QR tampering, RBAC) now pass — 98/98. Integration and E2E coverage still missing.

### P1 — Critical Production Functionality

8. **No notification system** — Artists never notified of offers, install windows, hold expiry, survey invites.
9. **No audit log viewer** — Admin cannot browse audit entries.
10. **No grievance response inbox** — Grievances filed but cannot be responded to.
11. **No artist scan analytics** — Artists cannot see their own scan data.
12. **No offer acceptance UI** — Waitlist force-match creates offers but artists cannot accept them.
13. **No condition photo upload** — Checklist item exists but no upload mechanism.
14. **No visitor withdrawal UI** — Consent withdrawal action exists but no page.
15. **No data retention jobs** — Personal data lives forever.
16. **No CI/CD** — No automated testing, linting, or deployment pipeline.
17. **No monitoring/observability** — No metrics, tracing, or structured logging.
18. **No backups/DR** — No documented backup or recovery strategy.
19. **No identity verification** — Artists cannot be verified for payouts.
20. **No GST invoice generation** — No actual invoices produced.
